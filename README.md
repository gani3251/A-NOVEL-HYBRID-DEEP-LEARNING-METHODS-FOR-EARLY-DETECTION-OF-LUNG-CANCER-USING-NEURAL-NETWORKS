# A-NOVEL-HYBRID-DEEP-LEARNING-METHODS-FOR-EARLY-DETECTION-OF-LUNG-CANCER-USING-NEURAL-NETWORKS
The project titled “A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Method for Early Detection of Lung Cancer Using Neural Networks” addresses the critical global health challenge posed by lung cancer by enabling early diagnosis through advanced deep learning techniques. Traditional diagnostic methods are often limited by late-stage detection and human error, making timely and accurate identification of lung cancer essential for improving survival rates. This project proposes a hybrid deep learning approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance diagnostic precision using CT scan imagery.

The model focuses on early detection of non-small cell and small cell lung cancers by automatically analyzing CT images and extracting key spatial and sequential features. A CNN is utilized for initial feature extraction from lung regions, followed by an LSTM to learn temporal dependencies and patterns indicative of malignancies. The system also integrates preprocessing steps like lung segmentation and noise reduction to ensure high-quality input data. The classification model is evaluated against standard approaches and imaging modalities such as SVM and traditional CNNs. Results show that the proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid delivers improved accuracy, reduced false-positive rates, and faster diagnosis, making it an effective tool to support radiologists and enhance lung cancer screening outcomes.
